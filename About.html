<h2>What are lamnidaes?</h2>
<p>Lamnidaes, lamniformes or Mackarel Sharks are a family of Shark that are adept in cooler waters. Some members of this family include some of the most infamous in history such as the Great White Shark. Lamnidaes are one of the most powerful and wonderfully adapted shark family. &nbsp;<br>
</p>
Some of their adaptions include:
	<p>
	- A rod to cone ratio of 4:1 meaning unlike most sharks, Lamnidaes aren't colourblind and have excellent vision in day and night settings!  </p>
	<p>
	- Unlike every other shark family, Lamnidaes are endothermic or warm blooded. This means they can regulate their body temperature similiar to mammals which gcontributes to their brain power that's on a caliber comparable to birds and big cats evident in their hunting methods and social structures. </p>
	<p>
	- Lamnidaes internal muscle system features red swimming muscles far closer to the core of their body and are much denser which givwes them unrivaled speed and endurance amongst the shark kingdom. 
	<p>
	- You're not safe~
