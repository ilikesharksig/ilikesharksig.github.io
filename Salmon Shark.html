<h2>Salmon and Porbeagle Sharks</h2>
	<img src="porbeagle x salmon.jpg" alt="">
<p>Salmon sharks are a species of apex predator found in the North Pacific Ocean. They're known for their streamlined bodies and powerful swimming abilities. Salmon sharks feed on a variety of prey, including fish, squid, and marine mammals. One notable aspect of salmon sharks is their ability to regulate their body temperature, allowing them to hunt in cold waters. Their high fat reserves also help conserve far more heat than those of their cousins. Salmon Sharks are distinct and unique in appearance having similar facial features to that of other lamb I’d sharks but their bodies are spotty in a more dusk brown or grey fashion. Unfortunately, salmon sharks are often caught accidentally in commercial fisheries, and their populations are monitored to ensure sustainability.&nbsp;<br>

	<p>Porbeagle sharks are a species of mackerel shark found in temperate and sub-Arctic waters in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as in the Southern Hemisphere. They're also known for their streamlined bodies and powerful swimming abilities (really all these sharks feel copy and pasted). Porbeagle sharks are apex predators, feeding on fish, squid, and other marine animals. Unfortunately, they're vulnerable to overfishing due to their slow growth rate and late maturity. Conservation efforts are in place to manage their populations and prevent overfishing. Some conservation efforts on our part is sacrifi-…...actually maybe we shouldn’t discuss that here.&nbsp;<br>
