<h2>Great White Sharks</h2>
	<img src="Great White Shark smiling.jpg" alt="">
<p>Great Whites are perhaps the most infamous shark. Known for their visceral senses and hunting, most see these guys as mindless killers (which isn't true! That's our job) Great Whites have impressive senses being able to hear low frequency sounds from over a km away, excellent vision that can distinguish colour and electroreception to sense the magnetic pulses emitted from living organisms. Great Whites are known for their insticts however the shark actually has impressive intelligence, especially for a fish. Great whites for one learn from other sharks and animal species. A case in 2017 where a lone Great White killed a Humpback Whale by severing it's tail immobilizing it and later drowning it, a hunting startegy usually employed by Orcas. Great whites occasionally even band together to take down bigger prey such as Elephant seals. When hunting sea lions, Great Whites are hyperaware of their surroundings, usually leading seal lions to locations where visibility is low and other sea lions cannot witness the attack. Contrary to popular belief in that these sharks attack us out of mistaken identity, it's contradictory to say they mistake us expecially given their huge array of senses. Great whites know that we aren't seals. They don't know what we are at all. They're simply very curious and cautious species exploring their einvironment. To them, we're aliens and so without hands their only option to find out what we are is to..well bite us.  &nbsp;<br>

Quick Facts:
	<p>
	- Largest predatory fish growing to 21 feet or 6.4m in length with Females averaging around 16-18 feet (4.8m-5.4m) and Males averaging around 12-15 feet (3.9m - 4.5m)  </p>
	<p>
	- Evolved around the Mid-Miocene (16-11 million years ago) meaning they coexisted with Megalodons. Great Whites aren't actually related to Megalodons and are instead more closely related to Makos and likely evolved from ancient Mako Sharks. </p>
	<p>
	- There are 3 different lineages of White Shark that don't interbreed with each other. Pacific, Atlantic and Indian ocean.
