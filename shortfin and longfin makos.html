<h2>SHortfin and Longfin Makos</h2>
	<img src="mako sharks.png" alt="">
<p>The shortfin mako shark and longfin mako shark are two species of pelagic sharks known for their speed and agility. Shortfin mako sharks are found in tropical and temperate waters worldwide and are renowned for their incredible jumping ability being spotted off the coasts of New Zealand jumping close to about 20 feet in the air. Unfortunately they do have a bad habit of jumping onto our boats…definitely not trying to feed you or- or anything like that~~~. Makos in general are also extremely fast, being the fastest species of shark reaching up to 46 mph (74 km/h). Longfin mako sharks are less common and have longer pectoral fins, but less is known about their behavior and habitat due to their rarity. Like their close relatives, Makos and White Sharks alike are both extremely intelligent species. Makos may even be smarter due to their high brain to body mass ratio, holding the title of having the highest ratio of all sharks. Both shortfin and longfin makos are apex predators, feeding on fish, squid, and species of sailfishes such as sword fishes and marlins. Unfortunately, both shortfin and longfin mako sharks are targeted by commercial and recreational fisheries, and their populations are considered vulnerable or threatened due to overfishing which is why we must protect them….not like we’re gonna feed you to them as punishment or anything like that~~~ &nbsp;<br>
